# M.O.R.G. (Motion Operated Reactive Greeting)
This is a robot that greats you each time you enter your home, he lives in a Raspberry Pi in my house above my cabinet. He uses the Philips Hue API to grab states from motion sensors and switch buttons to determine when I am leaving and entering my house. He then plays a variety of .wav files that are pre-recorded audios of a British man saying a greeting.

Version 5.0 is the latest, with complete refactoring and spacing out different methods into their own .py's.

The program is run from main.py in the v5.0 directory.
