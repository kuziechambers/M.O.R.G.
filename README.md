# M.O.R.G. (Motion Operated Reactive Greeting)
This is a project that creates a greeting robot that lives on a Raspberry Pi in my house above my cabinet. He uses the Philips Hue API to grab states from motion sensors and switch buttons to determine when I am leaving and entering my house. He then plays a variety of .wav files that are pre-recorded audio of a British man saying a greeting.
